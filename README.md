## Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of credit risk and portfolio optimization using machine learning techniques. By utilizing logistic regression and various other machine learning models, we conducted feature selection and compared model performances. Additionally, we explored portfolio optimization strategies, including Markowitz mean-variance optimization and the Black Litterman allocation model.

The key findings highlight the importance of features such as the MS score and demonstrate the effectiveness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in modeling credit risk. The project also includes a practical application of the optimization models through a user-friendly website interface.
